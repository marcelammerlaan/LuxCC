I have included a precompiled shared libc at obj/<arch>/libc.so so you don't have
to install any cross-compiler to get one.

I currently cannot use luxcc to compile the libraries because it does not generate
position-independent code (PIC) as required for shared libraries.

If you want to compile the libraries from source you can install the required
cross-compiler and do

    make -f makefile.shared

Check makefile.shared's variables to see what cross-compiler is required for each arch.
