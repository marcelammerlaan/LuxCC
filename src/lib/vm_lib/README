This directory contains a restricted version of the C standard library
that is used by the VM targets.

This version of the library contains mainly functions that are required
for self-compilation and to run the tests.

It is implemented upon the facilities reachable through the VM's `LibCall'
instruction.

The sources come mainly from:
  * The Sanos kernel: http://www.jbox.dk/sanos/source/lib/
  * The Linux kernel: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/

Note: when invoking the compiler (`luxcc') directly (instead of through
the driver) one needs to pass a `-I' option pointing to this directory
so the compiler fetchs the correct headers for this version of the library.
The driver does this automatically.
