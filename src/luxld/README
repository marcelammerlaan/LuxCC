Linker with support for i386, x86_64, MIPS, and ARM.

Static and shared libraries are supported.

Just a minimal set of input relocations are supported, mostly the ones that are emitted
by the corresponding assemblers. The only output relocations are of type R_*_JUMP_SLOT
and R_*_COPY.

This linker is primarily used to link against our own libc. It can be used to link against
musl too (at least in i386).

glibc almost sure is not going to work because of the input relocations of the crt*.o files.
